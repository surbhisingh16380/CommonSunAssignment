# Design Decisions for CommonSun Salesforce CRM Integration

## Assumptions

- The Salesforce org requires automation for lead assignment, opportunity revenue calculation, and stage updates.
- CommonSun Inc. uses custom objects and fields for handling sales processes, which were incorporated in the Apex triggers.

## Solution Approach

- **Lead Assignment Automation**: I designed a trigger to automatically assign leads based on certain conditions, ensuring efficient follow-up.
- **Opportunity Revenue Calculation**: An Apex trigger calculates opportunity revenue automatically whenever a related record is updated, improving data accuracy.
- **Stage Updates**: Stage progression is now triggered based on specific business criteria, enhancing workflow automation.

## Limitations

- The solution assumes that data volumes will remain within Salesforce limits for trigger execution.
- Future enhancements might require refactoring if more complex conditions or additional objects are introduced.

## Efficiency Improvements

- **Automation**: Reduces manual effort and increases sales team productivity by automating lead assignment and opportunity revenue calculations.
- **Accuracy**: Ensures that revenue calculations are done based on up-to-date information.
- **Scalability**: This solution can be easily expanded by adding more business rules or workflows as the business needs grow.
